# Crypt

Crypt is a very simple Cryptography program that uses a password to create a key, so the only thing you need is the same password as your friend to exchange encrypted messages.

This program uses [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) so it is not the most visualy pleasing in the market 

I recomend you create a very complicated password by using two or more big [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_numbers) like `7523 * 5419` that returs `40767137` followed by a random float number like so `random.random()` and a random selection of about 10 letters. a password generator is available in [main](https://github.com/guiloj/Crypt)
